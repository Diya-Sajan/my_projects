(UI design - Diya Sajan (My contribution to the Project)

I conducted research on the target audience, including government employees on election duty, individuals in remote areas, and the younger generation. 
This research helped me understand their specific needs and challenges related to the biometric voting system. 

For government employees on election duty, I focused on their difficulties in voting due to temporary relocation and demanding work schedules. 
I aimed to develop a user-friendly system that enables them to easily register, login, and vote. 
Regarding individuals in remote areas, I explored their accessibility challenges and aimed to create a voting system that overcomes geographic limitations. 

I also dedicated effort to comprehending the preferences and requirements of the younger generation. 
Through surveys and analysis of relevant data, I gained insights into their expectations regarding user-friendly interfaces and modern technologies.

Based on this, I designed wireframes and prototypes to establish the overall layout and flow of the user interface. 
The authentication screens included fields for username, password, and optional voter ID or registration number. 
I provided clear instructions and visual indicators for the facial recognition process. 

To ensure a visually pleasing layout, I used legible typography and a color scheme aligned with the voting system's branding or accessibility guidelines. 
Icons and visual cues were incorporated to enhance user experience and aid comprehension. Clear error messages were designed for authentication issues.

Overall, my research-driven approach and design decisions aimed to create a user-friendly and inclusive voting experience for the target audience.
